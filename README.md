# My First Portfolio

Features:
An About Me Page, a Contact Page, and a main Portfolio Page. 

This website was constructed using bootstrap to include a constant navbar, responsive layout, respnsive images, and a sticky footer.

It's layout was formulated to adjust to multiple screen sizes and resolutions.

I built this project to further enhance my recently acquired coding skills and to eventually showcase my work to future potential employers. I learned a lot during the past week and am glad to attempt to tie it all in to this project and to further expand on it upon learning new material within the next few weeks. 

Thank you,
LPN
